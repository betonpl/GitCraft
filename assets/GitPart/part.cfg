description = IMPORTANT! DO NOT ADD THIS PART TO YOUR SHIP. The part is only retained to provide the upgrade path for GitCraft 0.9b1 users. Please remove this part from all your designs that still use it and complete all missions that use vessels with this part onboard. The functionality of GitCraft does not require this part since GitCraft 0.9b2! The part will be fully removed in GitCraft 1.0 and ships saved with this part won't load in the editor and all missions that still use the part will be terminated when you try to fly them. There is an upgrade code path for the git revisions that use this part, which simply cuts the part off the ship so that you can still use the history that had this part in it. Hopefully, you didn't use the part to join two otherwise independent sections of your ship, in which case the upgrade code path won't really help you after 1.0 :)
