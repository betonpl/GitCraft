description = IMPORTANT! DO NOT ATTACH THIS PART TO YOUR SHIP. The part is only retained to provide the upgrade path for GitCraft 0.9b1 users. Please remove this part from all your designs that still use it and complete all missions that use vessels with this part onboard. The functionality of GitCraft does not require this part since GitCraft 0.9b2! The part will be fully removed in GitCraft 0.9b3. An upgrade code path will be provided for ship designs that still have the part attached, but it won't cover active missions!
